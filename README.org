* Msp.el

"MSP stands for My Simple Prettier. It's just a wrapper around the
Prettier binary. I used to use https://github.com/jscheid/prettier.el,
which worked very well for me. However, one day I did a git pull on
the Emacs repository, and all of a sudden, it stopped working. My
limited Elisp knowledge wasn't enough to troubleshoot the issue, so I
decided to write my own wrapper instead. It's very simplistic but
works well for my needs."
